                <p>My name is Le Van Huy, I was born on April 6, 2003, and I am 21 years old. I am from Da Nang, a
                    beautiful
                    city in Central Vietnam. Right now, I am a student at a vocational college.
                <p>I live with my mother and my younger sister. My mom works as a factory worker, and my sister is in
                    8th
                    grade. We live together in Da Nang, where I study and live.</p>
                <p>I like football, running, exercising, and listening to music. I like to listen to music, but I am
                    not
                    very good at singing. I also like to try new foods, especially mì Quảng, a famous local dish. When I
                    have free time, I like to run outside or play sports with my friends.</p>
                <p>I am learning English to improve my knowledge, talk better, and have more chances in the future.
                    Learning English helps me meet people from different places.
                    I like making friends, but I am a quiet and thoughtful person. I also enjoy talking to people who
                    like
                    technology and learning new things. I think we can have many good talks if you like these things or
                    want
                    to practice English together!</p>
